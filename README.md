### Brief

Minimum Requirements

You determine the form and function of your application. However, the app should meet the following minimum requirements:

•	The Application must run and be developed using the MEAN technology stack:
•	The App should use:
1.	Angular 6.0+ Routing.
2.	at least 4 Components.
3.	the server to read data from the database.
4.	the server to write data to the database.
5.	the server to update and delete data.
6.	The Application both Client and Server must be structured in standard, organised and consistent fashion.
7.	There must be a comment for each non-obvious line of code you add to the project.
8.	The submission process must be followed (see below).
9.	A User Guide should be added to the wiki section of your GitHub repository

Requirements for high grade:

Your app must meet and surpass all minimum requirements stated above. Your app must be innovative. Your app must go further than what you learned in the labs. Your app must be fluid, intuitive and aesthetically appealing. Your app code and User Guide must be of a professional level i.e. detailed, consistent and well structured. If you incorporate something that you think merits attention, please clearly highlight this in your documentation and code comments.

GitHub

GitHub must be used to manage the development of the software. You might also try using GitHub Issues. GitHub issues allow collaborators to track project progress through bug reports, milestones and labels. You will have the opportunity during the weekly timetabled computer labs to work on the project, and to ask the lecturer for advice. The lecturer will add issues and comments to your repository to record these interactions. It is likely that these interactions will heavily affect the marking of the project.
Rules
•	The code and documentation must be submitted, on Moodle, before the due date. I have provided an assignment submission link on Moodle. Follow the Submission process below.
•	All code and documentation will be stored in your Project GitHub repository. Nothing outside this repository will be graded.
•	The app must run.
•	Do not attempt to alter the code or documentation in your GitHub repository after the due date. Your grade will be impacted negatively if this rule is broken.

Submission

Your GitHub repository, along with the User Guide in the Wiki and Issues tracker and all other GitHub facilities, will form the main submission of the project. Nothing outside git will be graded!
Student Conduct
You should familiarise yourself with GMIT’s code of student conduct and the policy on plagiarism. In particular, note two things. First, students are expected to treat other students and staff politely and with courtesy. Second, it is assumed that all work you submit is being presented as your own work, unless referenced otherwise.
